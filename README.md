This repository aims to summarized various machine learning projects that have been worked on during lectures

In this repo, mostly I use some library such as:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

<h2>Cant Open the File? </h2>

In case you can't open the .ipynb file and get the error message, such as:

> "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"

You can open it from http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy-paste the link to that site.
