This repository aims to summarize various private project about computer vision using OpenCV library.

In this repo, frequently I use some library such as:
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* Numpy

<h4>Each Project has it owns explanation in the README file, so hopefully, it can help you out to understand the code better.</h4>

<h2>Cant Open the File? </h2>

In case you can't open the .ipynb file and get the error message, such as:

> "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"

You can open it from http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy-paste the link to that site.
